# BlogSite Web Application

This is an web project that for type and publish blogs, texts, posts. Project's backend is from ASP.NET Web API. And frontend is from React and Vite. Also we used MongoDB as database solution. You can access [here](https://blog-web-frontend-three.vercel.app/). You can do the following actions; 

- Log In With Auto-Auth
- Create blogs
- Read others blogs
- Delete only your blogs
- and more...

## <strong> Important Note</strong>
The codes are not allowed to access from users. Because the database connection strings, token generation actions e.g. The backend and frontend repositories are private.
