# BlogSite Web Application

This is an web project that for type and publish blogs, texts, posts. Project's backend is from ASP.NET Web API as a solution, MVC (Model View Controller) is used for this project. And frontend is from React and Vite. Also we used MongoDB as database solution. You can access [here](https://blog-web-frontend-three.vercel.app/). You can do the following actions; 

- Log In With Auto-Auth
- Create blogs
- Read others blogs
- Delete only your blogs
- and more...

## <strong> Important Note</strong>
The codes are not allowed to access from users. Because the database connection strings, token generation actions e.g. The backend and frontend repositories are private.
